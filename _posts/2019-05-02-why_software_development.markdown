Welcome to my first blog post here for Flatiron! Why did I decide to learn software development? My interests and passions always included the seemingly opposites of math/science and music/art. I had problems finding a career path that seemed like it would satisfy both the logical and creative sides of me and software development can do just that. When I was in my mid-twenties I went back to college to teach high school physics and math which required an intro computer science course, my introduction to the topic. After taking that CS course and looking more into the subject I ended up changing my major to computer science. 

I quickly realized how much problem solving, which I enjoy, was involved in programming and how satisfyingly logical it was, yet also had lots of room for creativity. Although I could see this as a career, I still had years of college ahead and life quickly got in the way and so the degree and programming got put on hold. I took an online course here and there but it was hard for me to find the direction, focus, and motivation I needed to succeed that way. I had been considering a coding bootcamp for some time and finally the health implications of my low income stressful job really gave me the push to make that decision and take that leap to apply. I was terrified to start this bootcamp but so far so good. I'm so grateful that I decided to learn software development and still get excited each time I produce eloquent working code. Every time I feel overwhelmed I've learned to ignore that and just dive in anyway. I know I have so much to learn in software development so I'm in for an exciting and challenging journey.
