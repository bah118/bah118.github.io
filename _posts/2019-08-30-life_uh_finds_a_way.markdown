Over the past weeks, I've gone through a lot of turmoil outside of Flatiron, making getting my work done quite difficult. Due to too many circumstances, I found myself needing to play some catch up to get my Sinatra project completed. 

Stress, pressure, worries... none of these are going to help me nor most code, or think for that matter, any better. In fact, they may do the exact opposite. I mentally worked to turn that stress and pressure into thoughts of excitement and opportunity. After all, our life can play out differently depending on our focuses.

I surprisingly ran into very few issues in coding my project. At the beginning, I depended on my old trait of overthinking of just topics alone. When I finally decided on something that matters to me, that I have a lot to keep track of (musical instruments) it was time to dive right into that somewhat scary territory of creating a brand new app from nothing (well, Corneal certainly helps ease some anxiety by getting us started).. but I put my worrysome thoughts aside and just dove in. I found with our lessons and labs, and now projects, it's really the only way for me to get going. I have to not think about it to get started or I overwhelm myself before I start.. and no good comes from that!

So I got my first Sinatra web application project done and didn't run into days of trouble as I worried I might. All the concepts I learned came together for me to create my first smooth running web app without much difficulty. It's also a great feeling to see the finished project in the browswer as compared to the CLI!
