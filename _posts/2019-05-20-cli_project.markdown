Today I finished my first portfolio project for Flatiron which invloved scraping data and creating a CLI. I experienced so many new things and some familiar things like that familiar overwhelmed feeling. Alas, now I get to experience that ‘it all works and it’s beautiful’ feeling! I just finished recording the demo of my project on Zoom and uploading it to YouTube. Both of those were scary firsts for me but they are officially done, off the bucket list. I’ll pretend that I didn’t re-record it about seventy times.

Something else that was new was working from GitHub rather than inside Learn.co’s IDE. I’m comfortable with it now but it terrified me at first because you could so easily lose some of your work. It was awkward to have to name each push. We get so used to just ctrl-s-ing so much that it’s intimidating to have to put a proper label for the world to see on basically each save. I have to admit it’s affirming to see my code out there in the world on GitHub like that. I think I now feel like an actual programmer.. a baby one, but a programmer nonetheless. Once I had the project working, I decided to be a bit extra and add some color using a colorize gem. I, for one, do no regret that decision.

With this first project, I pushed myself through obstacles and lots of self doubt. I came out believing in myself over a CLI project but I’ll take that for now!
